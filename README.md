Assisted Photography
====================

This repository contains the assisted photography application of the RERC-APT lab at Carnegie Mellon University (http://www.rercapt.org). The code was developed for iOS6, and works in iOS7.

The assisted photography application is in the AssistedPhoto folder. This app relies on the libraries in the frameworks directory, so you should compile them before running AssistedPhoto (see the README file inside the frameworks directory for more information).

NOTE: This code is not actively maintained and I can no longer offer support for it. However, it should be fairly easy to get the code running if you program for the iPhone and are familiar with XCode.
